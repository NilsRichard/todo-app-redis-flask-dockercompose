# todo-app-redis-flask-dockercompose
This is a little web application made with Flask and Redis in python. 
The app is divided between two containers (web server and database)

Make sure you have already installed both Docker Engine and Docker Compose. You donâ€™t need to install Python or Redis, as both are provided by Docker images.
